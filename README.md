## 课程简介
Assembly language is a programming language that directly faces and controls hardware, the fastest and most efficient. Learning to use assembly language programming is not only to master a programming method, but more importantly, to understand the impact of programs on machine characteristics, and to understand the computer system more completely and thoroughly. It is the basic of computer undergraduate graduates of research universities. Claim. This course is a basic course for undergraduates majoring in computer science. It is also a pilot course for many related professional courses (data structure, operating system, computer theory, microcomputer technology, etc.). The course combines "program" and "machine" to enable students to learn programming techniques on the basis of understanding the computer structure, and then to understand the working principle of the computer system, and lay the foundation of technical theory and practical application for subsequent professional courses. Beginning this year (2012), this course will continue to update the content, adding the content of the MIPS instruction set to provide instruction set understanding, mastery, and application for the subsequent "computer composition principle", "compilation principle", and "operating system" courses Support in other aspects; and directly lay the foundation for "computer system design big experiment".

## Course Outline 
This course gives a comprehensive introduction to the basic theory, programming tools, programming methods and application techniques of assembly language programming. The main contents include:
1) Number system, code system, representation of numbers and characters in computers, etc.;
2) 80x86 computer organization and protection mode
3) X86 instruction system and addressing mode
4) X86 assembly language program format and basic programming
5) C and X86 assembly
6) MIPS instruction set design ideas, different instruction classifications, instruction formats, instruction semantics;
7) MIPS instruction set programming, including mixed programming with C language and use of programming environment, etc.;
8) Combine with the micro-architecture of MIPS processor, explain some basic optimization principles of MIPS instruction programming\Hazard between instructions, etc.
